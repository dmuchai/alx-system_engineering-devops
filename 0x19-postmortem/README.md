0x19. Postmortem
Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error‚Ä¶ Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won‚Äôt happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

To provide the rest of the company‚Äôs employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.

Postmortem: The Great WordPress Apocalypse of 2025
Issue Summary
On February 27, 2025, at 17:00 UTC, our WordPress site encountered a catastrophic failure that resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error across all pages. The outage lasted approximately 40 minutes, with full service restoration at 17:40 UTC.
Impact
100% of users were unable to access the WordPress site.
Business operations relying on the website (blog, user accounts, and admin dashboard) were completely disrupted.
Revenue loss: Minimal since we don‚Äôt charge users (yet!), but the brand reputation took a hit.
Root Cause
The issue was traced back to a typo in the WordPress core file, wp-settings.php, where class-wp-locale.php was mistakenly written as class-wp-locale.phpp. This caused the entire WordPress initialization to fail, triggering the dreaded HTTP 500 error.

Timeline
üïµÔ∏è The Investigation
17:00 UTC - Monitoring systems failed to detect an issue, but a developer noticed the site was down while browsing.
17:05 UTC - A quick check of the Apache logs (/var/log/apache2/error.log) showed fatal PHP errors.
17:10 UTC - The infamous 500 Internal Server Error was confirmed, and the issue was escalated to the DevOps team.
17:15 UTC - strace was used to trace system calls and revealed a missing file error related to class-wp-locale.phpp.
17:20 UTC - Misleading paths! We initially assumed it was a permissions issue and ran chmod 777 (bad idea, don‚Äôt do this!).
17:25 UTC - We manually checked wp-settings.php and discovered the typo.
17:30 UTC - Fixed the typo, restarted Apache (service apache2 restart), but the error persisted. WHY?!
17:35 UTC - A cached PHP process was still running. Restarted PHP (systemctl restart php7.4-fpm).
17:40 UTC - Website finally came back online. Cheers! üéâ

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause
A human error (let‚Äôs blame the cat walking on the keyboard) introduced a typo in wp-settings.php, making WordPress unable to locate a critical core file. Since PHP doesn‚Äôt tolerate nonsense, the site crashed with a 500 Internal Server Error.
Resolution
Corrected the typo in /var/www/html/wp-settings.php.
Restarted Apache and PHP processes.
Verified site functionality and checked for other possible issues.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Lessons Learned:
Human error is inevitable. Next time, let‚Äôs not edit production files while sleep-deprived.
Typos in core files = instant disaster.
Clearing cache & restarting PHP services is crucial after fixes.
Preventative Measures:
‚úÖ Implement a proper deployment pipeline (no more direct edits in production!) ‚úÖ Enable error monitoring & alerts for quicker detection. ‚úÖ Use version control so changes can be reverted easily. ‚úÖ Add a file integrity checker to detect unauthorized or accidental modifications.

Conclusion
The outage was frustrating but educational. We successfully resolved the issue, and steps have been taken to prevent a similar event in the future.
Moral of the story: Always double-check file names, or better yet, don‚Äôt let your cat near the keyboard. üò∫üíª
